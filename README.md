Overview
This project aims to develop a dashboard in a React app using MUI that displays a sidebar, navbar, transaction log, and FAQs for a given dataset in a JSON file. The dashboard should be interactive, enabling users to view the data generated and the additional information and click to expand or collapse sidebars.

Case:
You are working on a project for a restaurant that aims to monitor sales and revenue generated from various food items. The restaurant has gathered data on sales, new clients, revenue generated, and traffic generated for multiple menu items and wishes to present this information in an easy-to-understand dashboard. Your task is to create a dashboard that features sidebars that can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on them. Furthermore, the dashboard should enable users to view the data generated and the additional information.

7. Implement interactive features, such as click events using React hooks or other libraries.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
